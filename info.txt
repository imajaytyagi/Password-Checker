# Hashing a password is a must 

url = 'https://api.pwnedpasswords.com/range/' + 'CBFDA'

# this api uses a technique called K Anonymity,
# K anonymity allows somebody to receive information about us
# yet still not know who we are
# we only give 1st five character of our hashed password
# it has a list of all the passwords that have been leaked however all these passwords are hashed with SHA1 algorithm
# it looks in its database of all these password and pick all the hashed passwords that have the 1st five characters that match this
# this way with a response we're gonna get all the passwords that are hashed that have this 
# so that on our end when we receive the response we can check the rest of the hash function 
# this way this api is never gonna know our full hash and therefore never ever be able to guess our password


# <Response 400> usually means somethings not right with the api
# <Response 200> means ok
